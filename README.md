# Using watch gestures to control PC

In this project, I designed and implemented a way to control my PC using wrist locomotion. 
I use a nine axis gyroscope fixed on my wrist to detect wrist locomotion, and then send data to my PC through a serial data cable.
Whenever I move or twist my wrist in certain ways, the program running in the background can detect it and send correspoding instructions to the PC.

A correlation test based on human feedback is also performed.
